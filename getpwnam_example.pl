This function returns a list of fields In list context, as extracted from the /etc/passwd file, 
based on the user name specified by EXPR. It's generally used like this âˆ’

($name, $passwd, $uid, $gid, $quota, $comment, $gcos, $dir, $shell) = getpwnam ($user);

In a scalar context, returns the numeric user ID. If you are trying to access the whole /etc/passwd file, 
you should use the getpwent function. If you want to access the details by user ID, use getpwuid.
